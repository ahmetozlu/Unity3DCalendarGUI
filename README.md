# Unity Calendar GUI
This is well defined-basic "Calendar GUI" for Unity3D. The GUI is very basic but it has pretty good functionality. You can get the date as a string when user selects the date via this GUI.

Please try to contribute this project because Unity has not GUI support for Calendar and there are not any free Calendar UI in Unity Asset Store.
